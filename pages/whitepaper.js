                        In an alternate universe where all creatures are aware of each other and live connected lives, we
                        as human beings may not be seen as the prime species. Hypothetically, there would be no primal
                        species because we are all living connected lives where we all play important roles.
                        Alright let&rsquo;s cut the bullshit, no alternate realities or universes. This project is the most
                        realistic way an NFT can be connected to the real world with actual benefits.
                        Luxury transportation is a dream to many and the founders of this project have spent the past seven
                        months working tirelessly to utilize the NFT marketplace and make this all possible.</p>
                    <p className="WhitePaperBlockText">
                        The MetaJetz project was founded by a group of creators that are driven to give people all over the
                        world the opportunity to possess an NFT that is the key to a new reality for a regular person. This
                        project aims to cater to the curious minds eager to be a part of the new and fast rising digital age
                        known as the metaverse. The globe travelers who enjoy experiencing new cultures and scenery. The
                        environmentalists who care about preserving our world that is being disturbed by global warming.
                        Look no further.</p>

                    <p className="WhitePaperBlockText">
                        How can an NFT cater to so many diverse and complex needs you might ask? A MetaJetz is an asset in
                        the form of an NFT that will serve as a key to many travel incentives whilst also earning currency
                        when rented in the metaverse. It is also a fully electric aircraft prototype which is an avenue to
                        raise awareness against the fossil fuel emissions traditional aircrafts create and harm our airspace
                        and environs. Steady donations from this project are made towards the research and development of
                        real life electric aircrafts.</p>

                    <p className="WhitePaperBlockText"> Owning a MetaJetz is having the best of both worlds, a stake in the web3
                        space and an appreciating
                        asset in today&apos;s world that provides utility towards exclusive travel packages and so much more.</p>


                    <p className="WhitePaperBlockText">The Sparrow 977, Seahawk 677, Speed Demon 477 and Bold Mamba 177 are all
                        aircrafts that holders will
                        stand a chance of owning. Private hangars and custom cabin crews are the name of the game with our
                        NFT&rsquo;s. A first of its kind is this project.</p>

                        Just like any major airline operating in the transportation and hospitality business, our project is
                        specifically tailored to serving our community first. With several months of conscious research, we
                        are here to really bridge the gap between the metaverse and the real world as simply as possible.
                        Creating avenues for everyone to get involved with the Web3 revolution as it is fast rising.
                        Cryptocurrency and smart contracts had a quite complicated introduction to many as it all seemed
                        like educated gambling for many and a trend for a quick increase to most.</p>
                    <p className="WhitePaperBlockText">
                        However, the phenomenon that is the metaverse, a world of virtual reality that will bring fantasies
                        to life and make the most unlikely experiences a possibility is a revolution for us all. We at
                        MetaJetz
                        are rolling out collections of NFT&rsquo;s that serve as assets in the metaverse with a wide range
                        of utility and fiscal properties. MetaJetz is a movement with longevity not a trend for clout.</p>

                    <p className="WhitePaperBlockText">As frontrunners in our industry, we pay attention to detail and plan to
                        leave our mark wherever our
                        products are launched. This is why 1% of royalties from jet renting will be donated to charities
                        located in cities a metjetz takes off and lands. This is one of our ways of giving back to the
                        community.</p>

                    <p className="WhitePaperBlockText"> Our planet is our home which we have to treat with care, all
                        MetaJetz&rsquo;s are fully electric
                        aircrafts. We have decided to do this as a measure to bring awareness to fossil fuel pollution and
                        its impact on our planet. Traditional aircrafts emit high levels of fossil fuel pollutants into the
                        environment whilst consuming a lot of resources to run. Our MetaJetz founders are constantly
                        donating to research development projects that will see the first fully electric running aircrafts
                        by 2027.</p>
